# BMI Calculator

This program should asks the user for they weight and height and reply with they BMI and a message based on their underweight, normal weight or overweight.

In this example the user inputs `80` for their weight and `1.85` for their height.

```shell
$ ruby bmi_calculator.rb     
How much do you weigh? (don't lie)
80
How tall are you? (barefoot)
1.85
Right now your BMI is 23.37
You have a normal weight, I have healthy envy of you
$
```

The BMI should have 2 decimal places.

Use the following ranges for the final message:

If BMI is less than 18.5
-> 'You are underweight, add more potato to the broth'

If BMI is greater than or equal to 18.5 but less than 25
-> 'You have a normal weight, I have healthy envy of you'

If BMI is greater than or equal to 25
-> 'You are overweight, I know, the pandemic has affected us all'

Assume that the user will input valid numbers.

Modify the file `bmi_calculator.rb` to meet the requirements.
